# Simple Flask Login Application

## Uses Bootstrap for styling
## Uses jQuery on profile page for logout event listener

### This is not intended to be a secure login form
### This is intended to be a boilerplate for a future login system

# Demo

![Landing Page (Login Form) On first load](/assets/images/on_load.jpg "Index Page on load")
## The index page on load. Contains a bootstrap card with a form for username and password.
![Landing Page (Login Form) if username taken and password invalid](/assets/images/username_taken.jpg "Index Page for taken username")
## The index page after an unsuccessful login attempt. If username exists but password does not match the password on file, will display "Username Taken" text.
![Profile Page](/assets/images/profile.jpg "Profile Page")
## The profile page on load. The logout button will redirect the user to the index page
